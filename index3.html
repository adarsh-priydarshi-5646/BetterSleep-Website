                    <li><u><b>Binaural beats for sleep:</b></u> Binaural beats is an auditory illusion that occurs when two slightly different frequencies are played in each ear, but is perceived as one fixed sound. Binaural beats therapy is an emerging form of sound wave therapy that helps combat anxiety and stress.</li>
                    <li><u><b>ASMR for sleep:</b></u> Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, is a feeling of well-being combined with a tingling sensation that starts at the head and travels downwards as a response to certain stimulus, often particular sounds.</li>
                    <li><u><b>Nature sounds for sleep:</b></u> Nature sounds like ocean waves, rain, and wind are the original white noise. They help create a relaxing sleeping environment when the world around you becomes too noisy.</li>
                    <li><u><b>White noises for sleep:</b></u>  White noise is created by combining sounds of all different frequencies together. If you have difficulty falling asleep or insomnia, creating a constant ambient sound helps to mask the noise happening in your surroundings by reducing the difference between background sounds and a “peak” sound.</li>
