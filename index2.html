            <h1 class="heading1">1. Make it a nightly Routine</h1>
            <p>To really feel the benefits of meditation it is essential that you make it a habit. Take your time, start with a short meditation. Be patient and kind to yourself, meditation comes with practice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="last2"></div>
        <div class="lasted3">
            <h1 class="heading1">2. Find the Right Environment</h1>
            <p>In order to get the most out of sleep meditation, make sure your bedroom is an oasis where you feel relaxed and comfortable. Avoid distractions such as laptops, televisions and tablets in the bedroom. Use white noises or relaxing music in the background.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="last3"></div>
        <div class="lasted4">
            <h1 class="heading1">3. Find the Right Position</h1>
            <p>Before beginning a sleep meditation, you should find a comfortable position so that you can gently fall asleep after your practice has ended. Turn off the lights, lie down, and snuggle up under the covers. The right position can help you with taking deep breaths, which are an essential part of meditation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="last4"></div>
        <div class="lasted5">
            <h1  class="heading1">4. Clear Your Mind</h1>
            <p>Notice your thoughts and let them go. We know this is easier said than done. The most important thing to remember is to not get carried away with thoughts and distractions while you are meditating. Be kind to yourself. Choose a mantra that reminds you to be aware of your feelings, but to let them go until the morning.</p>
